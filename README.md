# Image-similarity
Compare image similarities with CNN

1. Training from scratch

VGG_train.py
Train the classification model from scratch

VGG_train_load.py
Train the model from saved checkpoints

VGG_classify_eval_from_scratch.py
Test the trained model on evaluation data set

VGG_gen_train_from_scratch.py
Generate the training images vectors

VGG_eval_from_scratch.py
Generate the similarity evaluation results on evaluation images with training image vectors


2. Training from pre-trained VGG model
VGG_train_from_pretrain.py
Train the classification model from pre-trained model

VGG_train_from_pretrain_load.py
Train the model from saved checkpoints

VGG_classify_eval_from_pretrain.py
Test the trained model on evaluation data set

VGG_gen_train_from_pretrain.py
Generate the training images vectors

VGG_eval_from_pretrain.py
Generate the similarity evaluation results on evaluation images with training image vectors
